# Participedia Dashboard Redesign – User-Centric Data Storytelling with Power BI

## Overview
This capstone project focused on transforming Participedia’s existing user dashboard into a more engaging, guided, and intuitive Power BI experience. Participedia is a global platform dedicated to participatory governance. It houses hundreds of cases, methods, and organizations that are involved with democratic innovation.
Using Power BI, I redesigned the platform’s analytics interface to boost user engagement, uncover data-driven insights, and reduce the friction identified through real Google Analytics reports.

## Tools Used
- Power BI (DAX, Slicers, Tooltips)
- Power Query (Data cleaning and transformation)
- Excel (VLOOKUP to construct Collections dataset)
- Google Analytics (User behavior and engagement analysis)

## Problem Statement
Participedia’s original dashboard suffered from:
- Brief average session times (~35 sec)
- Confusing layout with poor data exploration flow
- Redundant or unusable data in downloaded tables (especially 'Collections')

## Strategy
- Conducted exploratory analysis using Google Analytics to assess issues with engagement
- Cleaned and validated data from Participedia’s downloaded tables
- Created a new guided walkthrough-style dashboard to make navigation easier and more intuitive
- Built visuals for demographics, participation types, and impact metrics
- Designed dynamic filters and callout bubbles for user education

## Dashboard Highlights
1. **Home Page**
- Dynamic cards show live totals of cases, methods, and organizations.
- Clickable map for country-specific stats.

3. **Cases Page**  
- Filters by country, issue, and date.
- Displays top-used methods and participant demographics.
- Click-through graphs linked to case examples.

4. **Methods Page**  
- Tracks online vs face-to-face methods.
- Visualizes spectrum of participation and interaction types.
- Informational tooltips guide users on interpretation.

5. **Organizations Page**  
- Analyzes organization types and sector influence.
- Filterable by country and scope.

6. **Collections Page**  
- Built from scratch using Excel and VLOOKUP.
- Focused on “Participation and Economic Advancement” curated collection.
- Highlights funders and organizers

## Projected Impact
The redesign addresses critical UX pain points that previously led to 35 second session durations. The guided walkthrough is expected to significantly increase session time and engagement. Standardization of data enables future automation and scalable insights.
